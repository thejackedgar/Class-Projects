# Email Application
Created in Fall 2022 for my Web Development Class (CSE186).
This project was intended to test our frontend and backend knowledge that we've accumulated over the quarter.
Throughout the quarter we used the so called NERP stack to create web applications:
Node JS,
Express JS,
React,
and PostgreSQL.
