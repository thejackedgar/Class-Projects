# Email Application
Created in Fall 2022 for my Web Development Class (CSE186).
This project was intended to introduce React in frontend development and show the importance of how React state can simplify an application. In a previous project we used the Javascript DOM to populate and update a calendar, and after I learned about React state I realized how useful it is since it greatly simplified the process of making and updating something like a calendar.
