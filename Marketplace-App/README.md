# The Grand Exchange - Marketplace Application
Created in Winter 2023 for my Web Development II Class (CSE187).
For this group project we had the open-ended task of creating a marketplace application similar to eBay or Facebook Marketplace. We called our marketplace application "The Grand Exchange".
Throughout the project we used the following tech stack to create our web application:
Node JS,
Express JS,
React,
TypeScript,
GraphQL,
and PostgreSQL.
